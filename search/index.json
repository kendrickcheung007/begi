[{"content":" Tip This article serves as a quick reference for Hugo-Stack. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in using it, head over to its source hosting platform on GitHub to access the source code. I recommend reading the Hugo and Hugo-Stack documentation carefully to help you build your personal blog with ease. Markdown What is Markdown?\nMarkdown is a light-weight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages. For more information, please visit Markdown.\nMarkdown syntax Blockquotes\nTo create a blockquote, add a \u0026gt; in front of a paragraph.\n1 \u0026gt; This is a blockquote. The rendered output looks like this:\nThis is a blockquote.\nLinks\nTo create a link, enclose the link text in brackets(e.g.,[display name]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses(e.g.,(htpps://link.com)).\n1 Go to visit [Google](https://google.com) The rendered output looks like this:\nGo to visit Google\nYou can also use it for jumping to the specific section in current Markdown file.\n1 Go to the section [Summary](#Summary) The rendered output looks like this:\nGo to the section Summary\nImages\nTo add an image, add an exclamation mark(!) infront of a [link]- mentioned above, for example below:\n1 ![Here is an example](/path/picture.jpg) The rendered output woulb be a picture which you link to.\nTip For more information about Markdown Syntax please visit Markdown document Shortcodes Shortcodes are simple snippets inside your content files calling built-in or custom templates.\nquote\nHere is an example of quote below\n{{\u0026lt; quote author=\u0026ldquo;author\u0026rdquo; source=\u0026ldquo;source\u0026rdquo; url=\u0026ldquo;url\u0026rdquo;\u0026gt;}}\nSome text here.\n{{\u0026lt; /quote \u0026gt;}}\nThe rendered output looks like this:\nSome text here.\n― author, source Bilibili video\nThe syntax below:\n{{\u0026lt; bilibili VIDEO_ID PART_NUMBER \u0026gt;}}\nThe VIDEO_ID can be founded in the URL of the video form Bilibili. For instance,the VIDEO_ID of https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Sg4y1n7c4/?spm_id_from=333.1007.tianma.18-4-70.click\u0026amp;vd_source=031b1e94f7352ad4e2d00a56d2314e71 is BV1Sg4y1n7c4, and the PART_NUMBER is optional. We embed this video into our page we could write down: {{\u0026lt; bilibili BV1Sg4y1n7c4 \u0026gt;}}\nThe rendered output looks like this:\nTecent video\nTo embed a Tencent video we use same syntax of Bilibili video but replace bilibili with tencent,and use tencent VIDEO_ID instead of bilibili VIDEO_ID. Take https://v.qq.com/x/cover/mzc00200koowgko/h0045wlodzy.html for an example,the VIDEO_ID is h0045wlodzy\nYouTube video\nThe syntax below:\n{{\u0026lt; youtube VIDEO_ID PART_NUMBER \u0026gt;}}\nLocal video\nSometimes, we are suppose to play our local video, here is the sytax to do so:\n{{\u0026lt; video src=\u0026ldquo;VIDEO_URL\u0026rdquo; autoplay=\u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo; poster=\u0026quot;./video-poster.png\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\nautoplay and poster are optional.\nTip For more information about Shortcodes please visit Hugo-Stack and Hugo Shortcodes Customize our own Shortcode For learning Japanese, I created a custom Shortcode, looks like this: [こんにちは]^(\u0026lsquo;kon ni chi \u0026lsquo;wa.)\nThe way how I create my own shortcode:\nWe create a html file layouts/partials/function/ruby.html, and this file\u0026rsquo;s content is below:\n1 2 3 4 5 {{- /* Ruby */ -}} {{- /* [EN]^(English) -\u0026gt; \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;ruby\u0026gt;EN\u0026lt;rt\u0026gt;English\u0026lt;/rt\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/ruby\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; */ -}} {{- $REin := `\\[(.+?)\\]\\^\\((.+?)\\)` -}} {{- $REout := `\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;ruby\u0026gt;$1\u0026lt;rt\u0026gt;$2\u0026lt;/rt\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/ruby\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;` -}} {{- return replaceRE $REin $REout . -}} We create a html file layouts/partials/article/components/content.html for exporting our custom content to the article so that we can rendered it. this file\u0026rsquo;s content is below:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 \u0026lt;section class=\u0026#34;article-content\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Refer to https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/responsive-tables-in-markdown/10639/5 --\u0026gt; {{ $wrappedTable := printf \u0026#34;\u0026lt;div class=\\\u0026#34;table-wrapper\\\u0026#34;\u0026gt;${1}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026#34; }} \u0026lt;!-- {{ .Content | replaceRE \u0026#34;(\u0026lt;table\u0026gt;(?:.|\\n)+?\u0026lt;/table\u0026gt;)\u0026#34; $wrappedTable | safeHTML }} --\u0026gt; {{- $params := .Site.Params -}} {{- $content := dict \u0026#34;Content\u0026#34; .Content \u0026#34;Ruby\u0026#34; $params.page.ruby \u0026#34;Fraction\u0026#34; $params.fraction \u0026#34;Fontawesome\u0026#34; $params.fontawesome | partial \u0026#34;function/content.html\u0026#34;| replaceRE \u0026#34;(\u0026lt;table\u0026gt;(?:.|\\n)+?\u0026lt;/table\u0026gt;)\u0026#34; $wrappedTable | safeHTML -}} {{- $content -}} \u0026lt;/section\u0026gt; And the last, we decorate it with css, we create a css file assets/scss/article/article.scss, the this file\u0026rsquo;s content is belows:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ruby { background: $code-background-color; rt { color: $global-font-secondary-color; font-size: 1.3rem; } [data-theme=\u0026#34;dark\u0026#34;] \u0026amp; { background: $code-background-color-dark; rt { color: $global-font-secondary-color-dark; } } } After that we exports this file by adding @import \u0026quot;article/article.scss\u0026quot;; to assets/scss/custom.scss so that we can use it.\nOk, everything is perfect, pretty easy right? Now you can use it in all of your articles(posts).\nEpilogue Hugo is my favorite open-source static site generator. Its lightweight, flexible, and incredibly fast performance are all extremely attractive features. With Hugo, building a blog is easy, and you can create your own shortcodes to customize the look and feel of your content. I spent some time learning about Hugo and creating my own shortcodes, which has been really helpful in styling my blog and making it uniquely mine. It\u0026rsquo;s been a lot of fun!\nIn particular, I love the Hugo-stack blog template. It\u0026rsquo;s a neat and lightweight design that looks great and performs well. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a simple, yet powerful blogging platform, I highly recommend giving Hugo and the Hugo-stack template a try. I hope you\u0026rsquo;ll enjoy them as much as I do!\n","date":"2023-03-01T18:09:43+08:00","image":"https://kendrickcheung007.github.io/p/get-started-with-hugo-stack-theme/banner_hu27496177db0f26476b71a144f58d275d_97442_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://kendrickcheung007.github.io/p/get-started-with-hugo-stack-theme/","title":"Get started with Hugo Stack Theme"},{"content":" Tip Artificial Intelligence is one of the most exciting and rapidly-evolving fields in modern technology, with new breakthroughs and applications emerging every day.
